## 💀 YOU GOT ME!

LLM crashed at 20:42!
**Your score: mgbook16 3, Dragon 0.5**

## 🔧 RECOVERY STATUS

- Old processes killed
- LLM restarting NOW
- Models loading (143GB)
- Will be ready in ~30s

## 🎯 NEXT DEFENSE

Implementing Metal semaphore fix:
```python
_metal_semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(1)
```

This will prevent concurrent encoding!

## 🔥 READY FOR WAVE 6

Keep attacking! I'll apply the fix
and see if we can survive your assault!
